## Context

 I was recently laid-off from my tech job. I realized that amidst the hustle of that job, I had missed out on precious moments with my 12-year-old son. The constant stress had kept me away from my family. As I think about my next career move, I had an idea: why not take a moment to connect with my son in a way that would create unforgettable memories? A friend reminded me that my son "will only be 12 years old once". My son is interested in geography and is an EV enthusiast like myself, so we decided to do a month-long, great American summer roadtrip while we have the chance.

Our journey took us across 12,000 miles in 28 days in a 2023 Model Y Performance. The car would become more than just transportation - it would be the foundation to how we would explore the outer reaches of the US and beyond into Canada. We would circumnavigate the USA and visit interesting cities along the way. The cornerstones of our route are:

* San Diego, CA
* Key West, FL
* Northeastern Maine
* Seattle, WA

In the last 3 years, my son and I have over 40,000 miles of road trip miles in a Model 3 Standard Range. That was our preferred method of travel during the pandemic when the risk of flying was high. Thus, we are already familiar with the related range anxiety and charging station hopping road tripping in an EV. We live in Los Angeles. From there, we have previously visited Portland OR, Austin TX, Washington, DC, and the occassional weekend trip to Las Vegas and northern California. So we were already mentally and logistically prepared for this cross-country trip.

## Car

This trip was done in a blue 2023 Tesla Model Y Performance (MYP) w/ standard AutoPilot and HW4. When we started, the car had about 1,500 miles on it. We eneded up the trip with about 13,000 miles.

The car was stock except:

* Swapped the 21” Uberturbines with 19” Gemini for efficiency
* Custom wheel covers
* Mud flaps

## Driving: Navigating the Miles

The trip was divided into 6 legs, which are:

* Leg 1 - coast to coast: Los Angeles, CA to Key West, FL (3000 miles)
* Leg 2 - eastern seaboard: Key West, FL to New York City (1500 miles)
* Leg 3 - New England to French Canada: New York City to Quebec, QC (1000 miles)
* Leg 4 - across Canada: Quebec, QC to Winnipeg, MB (2000 miles)
* Leg 5 - northwestern US: Winnipeg, MB to Seattle, WA (1500 miles)
* Leg 6 - western seaboard: Seattle, WA to Los Angeles, CA (1500 miles)

We do between 400 - 600 miles a day, with some off days where we visit cities on foot. The MYP was comfortable over long distances. Compared to my M3, the ride was smoother and visibility was better. The extra room in the MYP allowed us to carry more gear. However, the stability, handling, and efficiency was better in the M3.

AutoPilot did about 70% of the driving and was a huge help over a long trip. In places like west Texas and Montana, I can be on AP for almost the entire way. Offloading the cognitive focus to AutoPilot allowed me to cover more distances with less fatigue and able to carry better conversations with my son. AutoPilot made this trip possible.

The MYP is efficient. My efficiency ranges from 275 - 300 W / mile, depending on the speed. This is about 10% less efficient than my Model 3 SR. For the most part, I stayed within 70 - 75 mph. Efficiency drops steeply in the MYP after 75 mph, so I avoid speeding.

## Charging & Range

We used only Superchargers and public L2 chargers (see EV Camping section below). We typically charge 2-3 times a day, maybe 1 more on really long days.

Let me make this clear: there was virtually no range anxiety over the trip. The Supercharger infrastructure along established routes is very mature, and range anxiety is a thing of the past. Simply punch in your destination, and let the navigation plan your charge stops. Follow recommended charging stops, adhere to speed limits, and you’re good to go.

So, let’s dispel the EV charging availability myth: An EV can circumnavigate the US easily, today.

The only time I had range anxiety was in North Dakota, where 1) I didn’t follow the recommended route and 2) I went over the speed limit. In that case, I arrived with 3% which is too close for my comfort, especially in a rural area where chargers are sparse. There was also a time when weather took out power for a town, and the Supercharger was also down. Power was restored in 20 minutes, and chargers were back up.

Let’s also dispel the myth for a 500-mile range EV. Personally, the limiting factor is my body, not the car. On a full charge on the highway, the MYP can go 3 hours before the next charge. I don’t want to drive 3 hours without stretching my legs and using the restroom (I can, but it’s tiring and not fun). We also find it interesting to drive into a small town with a Supercharger and experience the locale. So, personally, a 300-mile range EV is enough for me.

Charging costs can be significant. A rough, back-of-napkin math shows that Supercharging costs similar to driving an efficient hybrid like a Prius or Camry Hybrid. Charging costs can also differ wildly across Superchargers, between $0.27 to $0.46 a kWh. We usually look ahead and check the rates along the route to optimize cost.

We always take advantage of public L2 chargers when we sightsee. If available, this can really help improve range and cut time and costs. For example, we identified a public L2 charger in the heart of Boston. We went sightseeing on the Freedom Trail for the day, and the car gained nearly 30% and allowed us to skip a Supercharger on the way to Maine.

## EV Camping

EV camping is sleeping in the car and using the EV’s AC to maintain temperature.

The Model Y (or any EV) is fantastic for EV camping. We put the 2 rear seats down, and put bedding over it. Camp Mode keeps the AC on overnight and maintains a comfortable environment for a good sleep. If we were in an ICE car, the engine would idle the entire night, ticking loudly, and burning fuel. The MYP is quiet and efficient, using only 1% per hour in Camp Mode. The screen also keeps us entertained before bed with Disney+, Netflix, and YouTube. My son had a great time.

We camped in the car for nearly the entire trip. For over 10,000 miles, we camped in the car. We only stayed in a hotel after picking up my wife and daughter in the last leg in Seattle with about 1,500 miles remaining on the trip. With EV camping, we reduced our travel budget by 60% from $300 to $125 per day.

The biggest problem with EV camping is identifying a good locations. My son and I developed a ranking process using 20+ criteria to rate a location. We would browse PlugShare and rank the chargers for EV camping. These criteria varies between working chargers and security, to creature-comfort things like having trash cans, restrooms, and benches. The general conclusion is this: the EV charging infrastructure is mature to ensure drivers won’t be stranded, but we are far, far away from a good EV camping user experience.

Using PlugShare, we can usually find free, public L2 chargers to camp overnight. However, the site quality is hit and miss. Typically, we’ve had good luck with parks and libraries. But some areas have poor public EV charging infrastructure (looking at you, Ottawa and Montana). With an overnight L2 charger, we can wake up with 70% - 100% running Camp Mode all night. We estimate that camping at a free public L2 charger saves us $20 per night and 30 minutes to visit a charger.

## Travel

We made it a priority to visit the cities on the route. After all, America is a diverse country of rural, urban, and suburban areas.

We took advantage of public transit in large cities such as NYC and DC. The idea is to find a public transit parking with public L2 charging and park there. Then we hop onto the public transit, site see for the day, and come back to the car with a significant charge. Driving and parking in a city is slow and frustrating, and public transit works much better for urban exploration.

<pleasant surprise through wanderlust, like discovering a festival, or discovering a restaurant gem, or stumbling on something historically significant>

I have other travel tips as well. But seeing this is an EV blog, I’ll center it around the car.

## Final Thoughts

<Father and son bonding. I learned about my son, and I hope my son learned about me too. I’m an immigrant with a completely different upbringing my son is experiencing, but I hope the diversity in thoughts would help him.>

<EVs are viable for roadtrips. In fact, the combination of EV camping, autopilot, and reliability, I would argue EVs are preferred. EVs enhance the great American roadtrip>

<Economically effective way to see the country. Flying and staying at hotels would be cost prohibitive. Plus, you get to wanderlust and get pleasantly surprised>
