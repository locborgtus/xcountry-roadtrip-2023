## Context

I was recently laid-off from my tech job. That job was very stressful and I was unable to spend much time with my 12-year-old son. While I consider my next career move, I thought this was a great opportunity to bond with my son before he grows up. He is interested in geography and is an EV enthusiast like myself, so we decided to do this month-long, American summer roadtrip while we have the chance.

This 11,000 mile trip was done in 28 days in a 2023 Model Y Performance (more details on the car later).

The route hits the 4 outermost points of the USA and through Canada:

* San Diego, CA
* Key West, FL
* Northeastern Maine
* Seattle, WA

We are relatively experienced EV road trippers. We have over 40,000 roadtrip miles in the last 3 years in another EV, a 2019 Model 3 Standard Range. We live in Los Angeles, and have road tripped to places such as Portland OR, Austin TX, and Washington DC in that car.

## Car

This trip was done in a 2023 Tesla Model Y Performance (MYP) w/ standard AutoPilot and HW4. The car was stock except:
